Please understand that we will need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to prevent unauthorized access to your data). This verification process may involve asking you to provide information or identification so we can match you to our records. There are exceptions to these rights in certain cases. For example, we might not be able to completely erase all data if we are legally required to keep it, or we might deny an access request if it adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. If we deny your request, we will explain why, provided it is lawful to do so. If you are in the EEA or UK and believe we have not adequately addressed your privacy concerns, you have the right to complain to your country's data protection authority (DPA). For instance, in the UK you can contact the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and in Côte d'Ivoire you can contact the data protection authority (such as the ARTCI – Autorité de Régulation des Télécommunications/TIC de Côte d'Ivoire, which oversees personal data protection). We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, but you do have the right to reach out to regulators at any time.",

By registering as a Contributor and using the Tada app to complete Tasks, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. In particular, you agree that Tada may collect information from your device (including precise location and sensor data) and any content you submit (photos, videos, survey responses, etc.), and may provide this information, along with analysis derived from it, to our clients for their business purposes.
