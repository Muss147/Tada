            answer: "A visual test helps to identify promising claims, logos, packaging design, or entire visual concepts before launching a campaign. This way, you can avoid making wrong and costly decisions and allocate your budget to what works best.",

            question: "How does the visual test work?",
            answer: "The monadic approach is the most suitable method for a visual test. Unlike a semi-monadic survey, this approach is more informative and less biased as respondents are shown only one visual per survey. This eliminates the possibility of participants being influenced by previous designs and answering differently.",

            question: "What are the methods commonly used to identify a target market?",
            answer: "To identify your target market, some methods may include analyzing your offerings, conducting market research, creating customer profiles and market segments, and assessing the competition.",
          },

            question: "What is a target group example?",
            answer: "A target audience refers to a group of individuals who share similar needs and wants. This group is often characterized based on demographics and socio-economic factors, such as \"unmarried women between the ages of 25 and 40 with a high income\".",

          {
            question: "How do you collect psychographic data?",
            answer: "When using the Appinio panel, data collection is conducted with the Psychographic questionnaire developed by Cronbach following a market analysis and deciding on core psychological segments.",
          },
          {
            question: "Why is it better to use psychographics than Sinus Milieus for TGA?",
            answer: `Sinus Milieus focus more on societal segmentation rather than individual segmentation, placing them within a political-sociological context. They do not correlate with brand perception or consumer preferences when it comes to purchasing decisions.

              The questionnaire used for Sinus Milieus has remained unchanged since the 1980s and is only applicable in Germany and about 20 other markets.

              So why use psychographics?
              Because business success depends on the individual consumer. Sociodemographic and behavioral data describe people based on externally observable characteristics—WHAT they do.

              But this approach overlooks a crucial question: WHY do people do what they do? Psychology offers well-established, stable, and internationally valid models to answer this. The most effective psychological models for uncovering a person’s "why" are rooted in their motives and attitudes. Unlike demographic factors such as age, gender, or income, psychological motives are independent of these variables.

              By understanding these underlying drivers, businesses can significantly enhance their ability to develop highly relevant products, services, communications, and brand interactions.`,
